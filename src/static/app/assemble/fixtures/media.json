				"desc": "<p>I developed all of the filtering logic for this search myself, from scratch â€“ no JavaScript libraries or frameworks were used except for jQuery. The programming was complex and had many nuances, but the experience gained along the way made it well worth it. I'm proud to say that this is one of the best examples of my independant, challenge-driven coding style.</p>",

I created a set of two controllers to power these searches, and wrote them in a way that has made them scalable and reusable for future projects. In addition, the design of the site provided an opportunity for me to explore and code designs that are bold and new to higher education.</p>",

Time constraints only allowed us to produce designs for a handful of the dozens existing templates, allowing me the creative freedom to fill in the gaps and design as I coded.</p>",
