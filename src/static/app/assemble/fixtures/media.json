The programming was complex and had many nuances, but the experience gained along the way made it well worth it. This is one of the best examples of my independant, challenge-driven coding style.</p>",

I created a set of two controllers to power these searches, and wrote them in a way that made them scalable and reusable for future projects. In addition, the design of the site offered me an opportunity to learn bold new approaches to building sites for Higher Education clients. This was one of our first clients that stressed an importance on ADA Compliance, causing me to rethink approaches to many different components we have built for clients in the past.</p>",

This was difficult to get just right, but was a welcomed challenge and taught me many new tricks with CSS flexbox.</p>",
